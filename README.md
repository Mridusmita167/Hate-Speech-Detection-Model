# Hate-Speech-Detection-Model
Hate speech detection is the model which identifies and detects the hateful and offensive speech being poured on the internet. Social media is a place for many people to make hateful and offensive comments about others. So hate speech detection has become an important solution to problems in today’s online world.
The dataset for building our hate speech detection model is available on www.kaggle.com. The dataset consists of Twitter hate speech detection data, used to research hate-speech detection. The text in the data is classified as hate speech, offensive language, and neither. Due to the nature of the study, it’s important to note that this dataset contains text that can be considered racist, sexist, homophobic, or generally offensive.

There are 7 columns in the hate speech detection dataset. They are index, count, hate_speech, offensive_language, neither, class and tweet. The description of the column is as follows:
index – This column has the index value
count– It has the number of users who coded each tweet
hate_speech – This column has the number of users who judged the tweet to be hate speech
offensive_language – It has the number of users who judged the tweet to be offensive
neither – This has the number of users who judged the tweet to be neither offensive nor non-offensive
class – it has a class label for the majority of the users, in which 0 denotes hate speech, 1 means offensive language and 2 denotes neither of them.
tweet – This column has the text tweet.
